# Ben's Game
Rebuild and update of the 2004 Make-A-Wish cancer fighting game.

This game was created originally in 2004 by Ben Duskin and Eric Johnston ("EJ"), and updated with help from Brad Post. Its development was made possible by generous help from Make-A-Wish and LucasArts.

You can see the game running, and hear a bit about it, in the documentary film [Batkid Begins](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3884528/).

Now it's 2022, and EJ has decided to get this running again, maybe even try it out on a lightfield display.
Rather than GLUT (the original window framework) I'm using [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/).
